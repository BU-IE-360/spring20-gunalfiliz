1. [How to analyze the traffic stop data](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/tutorials/)

    The Stanford Open Policing Project aims to help researchers, journalists, and policymakers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public by gathering, analyzing, and releasing relevant data from millions of traffic spots.The tutorial shows how to do some analysis with the Open Policing Project data. The example is important because it shows how social sciences can benefit from such data.

2. [Robust regression in R](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/robust-regression/)

    Least squares regression is sensitive to noisy data, robust regression is an alternative to it. Robust regression basically tries to reduce the effect of outliers. It is a good example to understand the application of robust regression in R.

3. [Running and interpreting variety of regression models in R](https://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rstatistics/Rstatistics.html)

    It is a comprehensive tutorial mainly about R formula interface, performing model comparisons, and running and interpreting variety of regression models in R. There are also four exercises and their solutions with detailed explanations, which highly contribute to one’s understanding.

4. [Forecast package in R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/time-series-analysis-using-r-forecast-package/)

    Forecast package in R is a fundamental tool to perform time series analysis. The article illustrates the application of time series with steps and by using forecast package. It is helpful for improving the ability of identifying whether the data is stationary or unstationary and predicting from previous patterns.

5. [A forecast of the future web traffic](https://michalbrys.gitbooks.io/r-google-analytics/content/chapter9/forecasting.html)

    The example is about creating a forecast of the future web traffic using Holt-Winters method. It is a relatively basic example which illustrates installing packages, using libraries in R, and attaining a chart.
